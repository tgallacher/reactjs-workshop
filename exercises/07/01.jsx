// Exercise 07/01
// ===========
//
// Now let's look at an alternative component pattern which can also be used to cross-cut concerns
// between child components, namely the "Render Prop" pattern. While the demo app doesn't currently
// define any Render Props directly, the Render Prop pattern is one of the most important patterns
// which are in use today for abstracting and reusing compnent state/logic.
//
// We will repeat the HOC exercise on capturing and displaying the current mouse position, but this
// time, instead of using a HOC, we'll use a render prop.
//
// Tasks
// --------
// ✅    You should complete the `MousePosition` component so that it supports the render prop pattern
// ✅    Your `MousePosition` component should listen/capture current mouse position, as we did in the HOC exercise
// ✅    Your `MousePosition` should offer the current mouse position coords as a single object parameter to any child components
// ✅    Your `MousePosition` component should update the current coordinates in real time, as the user moves their mouse
// ✅    Your component include the `MousePosition` component
// ✅    Your component should render the current X, Y position. The format should be: (x,y) including the parentheses, as before.
//
// 🚫   Styling is out of scope
// 🚫   You are free to add additional text, markup, but we will only be looking for the current X, Y position of the mouse
//
// Tips
// ------
// 🐨  Use the `onMouseMove` Synthetic DOM event to capture the current X and Y coords of the mouse
// 🐨  You solution to the HOC exercise could be a good starting point
export class MousePosition extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Start HERE (Render Prop Component)!
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Define display name so we can select in our tests
MousePosition.displayName = 'MousePosition';

// Add runtime prop validation
MousePosition.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.func,
};

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Start HERE!
      </div>
    );
  }
}

// Add runtime prop validation
App.propTypes = {};

export default App;
